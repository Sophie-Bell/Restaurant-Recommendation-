# Restaurant Recommendations üç≤
## Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and provide actionable insights to enhance marketing strategies, optimize product offerings, and improve overall customer engagement. Based on my analysis, **I will segment customers into clusters based on their purchasing behavior and preferences.**

## Project Description :open_file_folder:
In this project, I will do the following:
- Clean the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and duplicates
- Create relevant features from the dataset, such as user preferences, restaurant attributes, and location features.
- Transform data, such as one-hot encoding categorical variables or scaling numerical attributes.
- Visualize data to understand distributions, correlations, and trends in user behavior and restaurant characteristics.
- Create a user-restaurant interaction matrix, where rows represent users, columns represent restaurants, and the values are user ratings or preferences.
- Choose a recommendation algorithm, that best suits the dataset and the specific recommendation goals.
- Train the selected recommendation algorithm using the user-restaurant interaction matrix.
- Tune model hyperparameters for optimal performance
-  Define evaluation metrics for assessing the recommendation system's performance
-  Evaluate the recommendation system using the chosen evaluation metrics on a hold-out validation dataset.
- Generate restaurant recommendations for users based on the trained model.
- Use the recommendation algorithm to provide a ranked list of restaurants for each user.

## Getting Started

## Data Source :bar_chart:
The **raw dataset** comes from the [TripAdvisor Restaurant Recommendation Data (USA)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/siddharthmandgi/tripadvisor-restaurant-recommendation-data-usa). This dataset was scraped from the TripAdvisor website and has restaurant data across 20 cities in Washington, Texas, New York, New Jersey, and California

This data frame contains 10 variables that correspond to:

**Name of the Restaurant**

**Street Address**

**Location**

**Type of Cuisine Served**

**Contact Number**

**TripAdvisor Restuarant URL**

**Menu URL**

**Star ratings**

**Total number of people who rated**

**Customer reviews (Comments)**
